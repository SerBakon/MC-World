once you download the files make sure they are all in a folder, it should have files and folders like advancements playerdata all that, then you want to put them in your appdata > minecraft > saves folder.

Then you have to download NBTExplorer, once you do it it will automatically show all your minecraft saves, you just have to find the world there, then open the dropdown menu, find level.dat, then drop down that, then drop down "Data", then click on the "Player" box, and press the X at the top of NBTexplorer (Delete), then press the file icon, and save, and close it, and then you can open and host it.

By doing this you should of deleted the "Player" box inside of Data, inside of level.dat, this basically deletes the previous owners link, because you would spawn in with their whole inventory since technically you own the singleplayer world now, but when you delete the "Player" box inside of level.dat, Data, you are breaking the link, so then your playerdata in the "playerdata" folder inside the world gets linked and a new "Player" file is created and you have your stuff, and pets, that you had when you joined the old owners world, and im pretty sure the old owner when he joins the world now that he isnt the owner anymore, his inventory should also get automatically linked to his player uuid.
